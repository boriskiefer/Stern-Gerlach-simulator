    "**Who:** Undergraduate students in a second-year modern physics or introductory quantum mechanics course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they know:** Classical mechanics and electromagnetism. They understand that a charged particle in a magnetic field experiences a force, and that a distribution of randomly oriented magnetic moments should produce a *continuous spread* of deflections on a detector screen — proportional to $\\cos\\theta$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between the moment and the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What they need:** A concrete, visual experience of the moment classical physics fails — not as an abstract statement in a textbook, but as something they can interact with, break, and rebuild. The goal is not to teach the formalism first. The goal is to create the *question* that the formalism will later answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The gap between intuition and experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1922, Stern and Gerlach sent silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The deflecting force is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_z = \\mu_z \\cdot \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical prediction: $\\mu_z = \\mu \\cos\\theta$, with $\\theta$ uniformly distributed. Result: a continuous smear across the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observed result: **two discrete spots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This single image encodes three foundational principles that define quantum mechanics as a discipline:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Principle | What the screen shows |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **Discreteness** | Exactly two spots — $m_s = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$. No continuum. |\n",
    "| **Probabilistic outcome** | Each atom lands in one spot with $P = \\frac{1}{2}$, not because of hidden variables, but because the pre-measurement state is a superposition. |\n",
    "| **Measurement collapse** | An atom that hits the upper spot will, if re-measured along the same axis, always hit the upper spot. The measurement changes the state. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why static diagrams are insufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Every textbook shows the two-spot result. The problem is that a static image does not let students *probe* the boundary between classical and quantum behaviour. They cannot ask: *what if the noise were larger? What if the field were weaker? At what point does the quantum signature disappear?* These are precisely the questions that build physical intuition — and they require an interactive model."

    "## 3 · Solution Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal stack.** The deliverable must run without configuration in any standard Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, Binder, Google Colab). Zero custom dependencies beyond the scientific Python baseline. This is a deliberate constraint: a POC that requires a 45-minute setup is not a POC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical toggle as the pedagogical core.** The most powerful teaching moment is not the quantum result — it is the *transition* between classical and quantum regimes. The simulator exposes this transition directly: switch to classical mode and the discrete spots dissolve into a cosine-weighted smear. The student controls the crossover. This is more durable than being told the classical prediction fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thermal noise as the decoherence dial.** Real atomic beams have transverse velocity spread from the oven source. When thermal noise $\\sigma$ is large relative to the deflection, the two quantum spots overlap and the result is experimentally indistinguishable from the classical prediction. As $\\sigma$ decreases — or field strength increases — the spots resolve. This parameter encodes a genuine physical story: quantum signatures are fragile, and their observability is a function of experimental conditions, not just of the underlying theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurable metrics built in.** The simulator reports spot separation, overlap coefficient, and statistical significance at every parameter setting. These are not decorative — they are the handoff artefacts a technical team needs to validate the model against real experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter map\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dial | Physics | Pedagogical role |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **N particles** | Statistical sample size | Convergence — when is the pattern trustworthy? |\n",
    "| **Field strength** | $\\propto \\partial B / \\partial z$ | Spot separation — the primary experimental control |\n",
    "| **Thermal noise $\\sigma$** | Transverse velocity spread | The classical-quantum transition dial |\n",
    "| **Screen distance** | Drift length post-magnet | Amplifies or compresses deflection |\n",
    "| **Mode toggle** | Quantum vs. classical physics | Direct comparison — the gap made visible |"

    "This POC is intentionally minimal. The following extensions are natural next steps for a production or research-grade version:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physics fidelity.** Replace `run_quantum` with numerical integration of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation through the field region (e.g., split-operator method on a 2D grid). This gives realistic trajectory curvature and models the finite transit time through the magnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Higher spins.** Parameterise on $s \\in \\{\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1, \\tfrac{3}{2}, 2\\}$ to show $2s+1$ spots. The architecture of `run_quantum` already supports this with a one-line change to `np.random.choice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential measurements.** Chain two Stern-Gerlach stages with a variable relative angle. This is the canonical demonstration that quantum measurement is non-commutative — and the natural bridge to the qubit and quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reproducibility.** All runs can be seeded via `np.random.seed(n)` for exact reproducibility. Add a seed widget to make published results fully reproducible from the notebook alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation.** The `chi2 / p_value` metric in the metrics panel is the primary quantitative check. A production version should compare simulated spot positions against the 1922 Stern-Gerlach data (Zeitschrift für Physik, 1922) and against modern tabletop reproductions.\n",
